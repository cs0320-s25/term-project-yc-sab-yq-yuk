Taught by two displaced, endangered scholars, these seminars are an important way for Consortium scholars to reconnect with students, the classroom, and the academic world more generally. While safe from threats of violence and retribution, many of our scholars remain in a second exile on the campuses of their host universities.
Building Bridges: Topics in Arabic Literature in Translation
Every Thursday, March 6 – May 8, 2025 | 9:00 -10:30 AM ET
This free 10-week course will delve into the profound role of translated Arabic literature in fostering a connection between Arab and Western cultures, aiming to transcend stereotypes and Orientalism. Over ten weeks, the seminar will examine the evolution of the translation movement for Arabic literary texts, probing the barriers that hinder the rightful recognition of Arabic literature in the broader literary canon. The curriculum is designed to assess how translated Arabic literature can contribute to enriching Arab cultural identity, countering historical stereotypes rooted in the Western consciousness.
Emphasizing the bridging of ages and cultures, the course explores seminal works like The Arabian Nights and Kalila Wa Dimnah while also delving into modern themes such as the intersection of Arabic literature and ecofeminism, and contemporary Arabic exile literature. Through engaging debates and readings, students are invited to cultivate a nuanced understanding of the challenges, controversies, and transformative potential inherent in the translation and reception of Arabic literary texts, ultimately fostering a meaningful connection between Arab and Western societies through the powerful medium of literature.",Online only,https://events.brown.edu/event/306228-building-bridges-topics-in-arabic-literatur,,,0,0,0.0

6,Complete Disorder: Resistance and Refusal to Colonial Legacy in the Arts and Humanities,"2025-05-08 10:00:00","2025-05-08 18:00:00",EDT,Virtual,"“Decolonization, which sets out to change the order of the world, is, obviously, a program of complete disorder.” - Fanon
In her book Programme of Absolute Disorder, Francois Vèrges speaks directly to practitioners within the realms of arts and culture to call for visionary, imaginative thinking in order to imagine arts, culture, heritage, and cultural spaces outside of the dominant world order created by colonial legacy. Rooted in theory from the Black radical tradition, she advocates for institutions by and for those who have been historically erased and exploited to maintain the apparatus of white western world order.
This conference asks: is it possible to transform cultural and academic institutions from sites of colonial harm into spaces of justice, care, and community? Bringing together museum professionals, scholars, artists, and community leaders, we explore how museums, archives, and institutions alike are confronting their colonial legacies towards reparative futures.
Through critical conversations and activities, sessions will examine challenges and possibilities for repatriation, community-driven exhibitions, archival intervention, and reimagining history telling. Topics include decolonization efforts across indigenous communities and university campuses, alternative practices that challenge the colonial violence of the archive, the nuances of representing Japanese American wartime incarceration, the role of Black artistic production and curatorial methods as a catalyst for political action during global crisis, and the complexities of aesthetics from a Black feminist lens to explore the possibilities of creating equity in arts institutions.
Through these topical sessions, attendees will explore a variety of ways that decolonial theory can be practiced from grass roots activism to hegemonic disruption– moving beyond symbolic gestures towards transformative, community-centered change.

Examining Authorship Representation in Southeast Asian Climate Research: Challenges and Opportunities for Inclusivity
Southeast Asia (SEA) faces environmental and socioeconomic challenges that leaves the region vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, the extent to which SEA researchers affiliated with SEA institutions have contributed to the region’s climate science has not been comprehensively quantified. This study examines authorship representation in SEA climate research using metadata from publications between 2014 and 2023. We quantify SEA representation by analyzing authorship demographics, institutional affiliations, publisher locations, funding acknowledgments, and citation distributions. Collectively, nine of the ten SEA nations participate considerably in the region’s climate literature, representing 30.76% of the total author pool and contributing to 64.33% of the total articles in the dataset. However, country-scale contributions are generally led by the United States, China, and Japan across all the authorship and publication metrics examined. Combined, these three countries alone comprise 37.45% of all authors, producing 56.79% of all articles examined. Additionally, 90.26% of the journals publishing SEA climate research are based in the United States and Europe. The stark contrast in country-scale participation between local and external researchers underscores issues of representation in the production and dissemination of climate-related knowledge in this region. By quantifying these trends, this study provides insights into some of the key challenges to authorship equity and opportunities to expand local research participation in SEA climate science.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/310559-diac-lunch-bunch-justin-custado,41.826,-71.4013,0,0,0.0

How the U.S. policy of competition with China is detrimental to democracy, peace, and prosperity—and how a saner approach is possible

For close to a decade, the U.S. government has been preoccupied with the threat of China, fearing that the country will “eat our lunch,” in the words of Joe Biden. The United States has crafted its foreign and domestic policy to help constrain China’s military power and economic growth. Van Jackson and Michael Brenes argue that great-power competition with China is misguided and vastly underestimates the costs and risks that geopolitical rivalry poses to economic prosperity, the quality of democracy, and, ultimately, global stability.

This in-depth assessment of the trade-offs and pitfalls of protracted competition with China reveals how such a policy exacerbates inequality, leads to xenophobia, and increases the likelihood of violence around the world. In addition, it distracts from the priority of addressing such issues as climate change while at the same time undercutting democratic pluralism and sacrificing liberty in the name of prevailing against an enemy “other.” Jackson and Brenes provide an informed and urgent critique of current U.S. foreign policy and a road map toward a saner, more democratically accountable strategy of easing tension and achieving effective diplomacy.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/310739-michael-brenes-the-rivalry-peril-how-great-power,41.8243,-71.3999,0,0,0.0

Seminars are held virtually on the second Thursday of each month.
Thursday, May 8th, 2025 (12:00pm-1:00pm)
Please join us as, Wafik S. El-Deiry, MD, PhD, FACP, Director Legorreta Cancer Center, Attending Physician at Brown University Health speaks on, “Translational Therapeutics targeting Cancer Cell Death”
Dr. El-Deiry will discuss his career path as a physician-scientist, practicing oncologist, entrepreneur, academic leader and will review some key discoveries made about cancer up to his ongoing present research. Dr. El-Deiry defined the genomic DNA-binding response element for tumor suppressor p53 (guardian of the genome) and discovered p21(WAF1), universal cell cycle inhibitor that explained DNA-damage cell division response. p21(WAF1) or CDKN1A was a seminal discovery about control of cell division published in 1993 that was the most highly cited original research in the journal Cell for >20 years. He discovered the innate immune TRAIL receptor DR5 and ONC201/TIC10 as cancer therapeutic. ONC201/TIC10 has clinical efficacy in H3K27M-mutated diffuse midline-gliomas and tumors without H3K27M including neuroendocrine tumors, prostate and endometrial cancers. Dr. El-Deiry continues to pursue rational experimental therapeutics, translational clinical trials and is trying to advance the field of Precision Oncology. His lab has also been interested in mitigating the toxicity of anti-cancer agents and in personalizing dose of cancer therapy based on host factors.
About Dr. El-Deiry
Dr. El-Deiry is an American Cancer Society Professor, the Director of the Legorreta Cancer Center at Brown University, the Associate Dean for Oncologic Sciences at the Warren Alpert Medical School and is Mencoff Family University Professor of Medical Science at Brown. He is a practicing physician-scientist and medical oncologist at Brown University Health who sees patients with colorectal cancer and is a translational-oncology investigator focused on cell death, cancer drug resistance, new cancer drugs, and precision oncology. Dr. El-Deiry is one of a handful of people in the world who discovered a cancer suppressor (TRAIL receptor DR5), discovered a drug that activates its cancer suppressive molecular and cellular pathway, ONC201/TIC10/ Dordaviprone, founded the company that licensed the drug (Oncoceutics, Inc. acquired by Chimerix, Inc. in 2021), and the drug is in process towards FDA approval for shrinking aggressive brain tumors. In 2023, Dr. El-Deiry was named as Top Doctor in Oncology in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and was elected Chair of Worldwide Innovative Network (WIN)-Consortium in Personalized Cancer Medicine.

Register here to attend.
See the full program here.
Statement of Purpose: During the last decade, U.S.-China relations have lurched dangerously into intensive militarized rivalry. This rivalry has the gravest possible implications for world peace, since the threat of war now looms over disputes in the South China Sea and also the ever-volatile Taiwan issue. As in the last Cold War, there is additionally the possibility that geopolitical rivalry will intensify disputes from Eastern Europe to the Arctic to the Middle East to Africa and throughout the Asia-Pacific. Moreover, this rivalry is already diverting resources and attention from other key issues, including global health and development, economic cooperation, and the climate crisis. This conference is intended as the first in a series and has five major goals: 1) to build a community of scholars dedicated to defusing U.S.-China rivalry; 2) to debate and refine arguments that favor mitigating geopolitical tensions between the superpowers; 3) to publish and disseminate the highest quality scholarship assessing the process of growing US-China militarized rivalry; 4) to develop concrete policy recommendations for curtailing military tensions among the two Asia-Pacific powers; and 5) to cultivate a new generation of experts that are capable of guiding US-China relations onto a more peaceful and collaborative path.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/310721-defusing-militarized-rivalry-between-the-us-and,41.8243,-71.3999,0,0,0.0

You are invited to contribute to an uplifting conversation that aims to help bring about unity and justice in a very divided world. This week’s topic will be “Open Discussion - All Aspects of the Baha’i Faith”.
Come bring your questions and/or concerns. No topic off limits.
This event is facilitated by Paul Smith (paul_smith@brown.edu), a volunteer Religious Life Affiliate for the Baha’i Faith at Brown. He is available for individual consultation or e-mail discussion with any interested student or group of students. While primarily focused on students at all levels, the Baha’i Faith at Brown welcomes staff and faculty as well.
Members of the Baha’i Faith (https://bahai.org) encourage and welcome people of all spiritual backgrounds (including none at all). Baha’is believe that all the world’s religions come from the same Source, and that all people can be welcomed into the activities of a worldwide grassroots community-building effort. Baha’i teachings include the equality of women and men, the harmony of science and religion, the elimination of prejudice of all kinds, racial and social justice, and the oneness of all humankind. Since 1844, the independent worldwide Baha’i community has been building a new global civilization from the ground up following these teachings, person by person, neighborhood by neighborhood.

Register here to attend.
See the full program here.
Statement of Purpose: During the last decade, U.S.-China relations have lurched dangerously into intensive militarized rivalry. This rivalry has the gravest possible implications for world peace, since the threat of war now looms over disputes in the South China Sea and also the ever-volatile Taiwan issue. As in the last Cold War, there is additionally the possibility that geopolitical rivalry will intensify disputes from Eastern Europe to the Arctic to the Middle East to Africa and throughout the Asia-Pacific. Moreover, this rivalry is already diverting resources and attention from other key issues, including global health and development, economic cooperation, and the climate crisis. This conference is intended as the first in a series and has five major goals: 1) to build a community of scholars dedicated to defusing U.S.-China rivalry; 2) to debate and refine arguments that favor mitigating geopolitical tensions between the superpowers; 3) to publish and disseminate the highest quality scholarship assessing the process of growing US-China militarized rivalry; 4) to develop concrete policy recommendations for curtailing military tensions among the two Asia-Pacific powers; and 5) to cultivate a new generation of experts that are capable of guiding US-China relations onto a more peaceful and collaborative path.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/310722-defusing-militarized-rivalry-between-the-us-and,41.8243,-71.3999,0,0,0.0

Jumuah prayer is held on the Brown campus while classes are in session. Only one service is held each week.
Conflicts and accommodation. You may occasionally have a course obligation that unavoidably conflicts with Jumuah prayer. Brown’s religious observance policy requires faculty, upon being notified by their students, to make reasonable accommodations for prayer and holiday observance. Most faculty will happily do their best to work it out. If this is your situation, please politely inform your instructor of your obligation as early as possible in the semester. A note to the faculty can easily be arranged if requested. If there’s a more complicated issue, or if you are facing a resistant or punitive faculty member, please email Imam Amir to discuss.

Call for volunteers. To set up up for prayer and clean up after lunch, we need volunteers! With regular help, this can easily be completed in ten minutes or less on each end. Please sign up here if you can give your time. These volunteers will work under the direction of the BMSC Coordinator (see next section) and Imam Amir.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/304782-jumuah-prayer-muslim-friday-service,41.8268,-71.4031,0,0,0.0

Abstract: 
Recent advances in seismic data from global and regional networks have substantially improved the resolution of three-dimensional images of Earth’s interior. These models reveal complex mantle structures at various depths and scales, yet the physical and chemical origins of many seismic heterogeneities remain unclear. Interpretation is challenged by factors such as limited resolution in seismic imaging, differential sensitivity of bulk and shear wave velocities, and the non-unique conversion of seismic parameters into thermochemical properties. I will present new approaches to better characterize key seismic anomalies and explore their geological significance. The focus will be on: (1) low-velocity pockets at the continental lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and their geodynamic roles, (2) high- and low-velocity anomalies in the mantle transition zone and their formation mechanisms, and (3) the origin of mega ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs) near the core-mantle boundary. The methodologies include traveltime tomography, high-frequency body wave attenuation analysis, and three-dimensional waveform modeling of refracted and diffracted seismic phases. By integrating these seismic observations with constraints from mineral physics and anelastic constitutive models, I will discuss how these anomalies reflect a dynamic and episodic history of material exchange and convective processes across major thermochemical boundaries and mantle phase transitions.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/305197-geophysics-lunch-bunch-junghun-song,41.8259,-71.3995,0,0,0.0

The World Health Organization (WHO) is in a moment of crisis. The decision by the US to withdraw from the organization leaves the WHO with a deficit of about 15% of its total funding through the end of 2025 and 45% projected for 2026-27. The current crisis is new, but it lays bare long-standing, untenable realities:
The WHO is overly dependent on a single global superpower to function;
The WHO is doing too many things, which comes at the cost of effectively carrying out its core, essential functions;
Member states from low-middle-income countries are disproportionately dependent on the WHO to deliver essential healthcare.
To avoid falling into a new dependency trap WHO Member States should consider the following questions:
What are the core functions of the WHO that member states cannot lose without major negative consequences for their health status?
What functions of the WHO are duplicative of work done by another UN or global institution? and
Which local institutions can be leveraged in each member state to fulfil roles currently carried out by the WHO?
To discuss the issues, Pandemic Center senior adviser Wilmot James, Ph.D. will convene a panel of experts including:
Mitchell Wolfe, MD, MPH, RDML Senior Associate (Non-resident), Global Health Policy, Center for Strategic and International Studies, and former Chief Medical Officer for the US CDC.
Nahid Bhadelia, MD, MALD Founding Director, CEID; Founding Director, BEACON; Associate Professor, Infectious Diseases, Boston University School of Medicine; Global Health Security, Boston University Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies

Comets are the most primitive objects in the solar system, and hold crucial insights into the early solar nebula. These icy bodies store volatiles that are periodically released, providing a window into their composition and internal processes. Among the various mechanisms of volatile release, outbursts represent the most extreme and energetic events. Such outbursts have been observed across a variety of cometary bodies, including Jupiter-family comets, centaurs, and dynamically new comets. These phenomena occur under a range of conditions: during local night and midday, at perihelion, and even around aphelion. The Rosetta mission provided unprecedented observations of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, documenting dozens of outbursts and their locations. Despite these observations, the subsequent effects on the comet’s landscapes have remained unexplored. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the surface changes induced by these outbursts. We show that cliff collapses, pit formation, and mass smooth terrain loss are all capable of sourcing outbursts. These observations will prove critical to follow-up modeling studies that seek to understand the physical release process, and how these most energetic processes shape the long-term evolution of cometary landscapes.
Sierra Khan (Brown DEEPS) – Regolith Thickness in Lunar Mare and Highlands: Insights from (Non-)rocky Ejecta Craters
This study looks at the Moon’s regolith thickness in two major regions: the highlands and the mare. Regolith forms over time due to constant meteorite impacts, so regolith thickness can tell us about the Moon’s surface age and history. To measure this, we used Narrow-Angle Camera (NAC) images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, focusing on craters with and without visible rocks in their ejecta. We examined 207 craters over nine regions, with three areas being in the mare and six in the highlands.
The results confirm that the highlands have a thicker regolith than the mare, which is consistent with the idea that the highlands are older and have been exposed to impacts for longer. We then estimated that the bedrock excavation depth is roughly 7.5 meters in the highlands and 5.0 meters in the mare. On average, the highlands have about 11.1 meters of regolith, while the mare has 7.9 meters. While these numbers mostly align with past studies, the regolith in the mare appears slightly thicker than expected, which may be due to local differences in the region. This research helps confirm how regolith thickness varies across the Moon.",Hybrid,https://events.brown.edu/event/303461-planetary-lunch-bunch-matthew-moser-and-sie,41.826,-71.4013,0,0,0.0

His talk is titled, “Better Health, Fairer Outcomes? The Past, Present and Future of Health Inequality in England.”
Large and persistent social inequalities in health exist within all modern societies but our understanding of what drives changing social patterns of health - and what policy makers and health service providers can do to shift these patterns - remains constrained by the fundamental challenge of disentangling complex causal pathways with deep historical roots. Efforts to identify effective interventions to address inequalities are also constrained by a lack of equity-informative research methods.
In this talk, Tim Doran (Professor of Health Policy at the University of York) will first draw on interdisciplinary collaborations between archaeologists, economists, epidemiologists, historians and policy researchers to describe the emergence of social patterns in health in Britain over the past two thousand years. He will then discuss the policy and health system response to existing inequalities, focusing on novel analytical approaches that integrate health equity into mainstream healthcare quality assurance, illustrating how this approach has been applied in the English National Health Service and discussing how it could be applied in other settings.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/310973-hsr-seminar-series-with-dr-tim-doran,41.824,-71.407,0,0,0.0

Featuring Erica Walker, RGSS Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health
With opening remarks by Provost Francis J. Doyle III
Audience Q&A and reception to follow.
About the event
Recently, while installing an air and noise pollution monitoring network in a small rural town preparing for the arrival of one of the world’s largest manufacturing plants, a simple comment from a local leader captured a deeper truth: “We didn’t think you were going to show up.” Unfortunately, this sentiment is far too common. Across the country, communities express deep skepticism toward academic researchers — especially in public health — citing broken promises, lack of follow-through and a failure to listen.
In this talk, Erica Walker, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health, offers a candid reflection — a “love letter” to the field of public health — on how researchers can regain the trust of the communities they seek to serve. Drawing on personal experiences as a noise pollution researcher, Walker will challenge attendees to rethink the way academic work is approached, urging a shift away from what they call “academic noise”: focusing on the wrong questions in the wrong places at the wrong time. Join us for a powerful conversation about showing up, listening deeply, and ensuring our research truly matters.
About the speaker
Erica Walker is the RGSS Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health and the founder of the Community Noise Lab. Her research focuses on measuring community-level environmental pollutants and assessing their impacts on adolescent health, particularly in overlooked and underinvested areas.
About the series
Scientists and engineers are often perceived as living intellectual lives that are mysterious — simultaneously wondrous and arcane. The Brown University Presidential Colloquium Series, Thinking Out Loud: Deciphering Mysteries of Our World and Beyond, showcases profoundly creative and accomplished scholars who not only tackle some of the biggest “Big Questions” there are, but also skillfully communicate their inner visions to broad audiences.

Weekly Bible Study Series

Manning Chapel
  J O S E P H • Genesis 37-50
Join us at 6PM every Thursday while we explore the life of Joseph as God prepared him for a bigger future than he could ever imagine.
Each week we will enter through Joseph’s lens on what God was doing in his life using the Bible as our guide to understand the time, context, and how we are to experience the same journey that Joseph did today.
We will participate in breakout groups and then we will come back together for a community discussion with opportunities for trivia and winning some cool encouraging swag.
Invite someone each week to experience how they could ignite their faith every day for the rest of their lives.

_____________________________
Jumuah prayer is held on the Brown campus while classes are in session. Only one service is held each week.
Conflicts and accommodation. You may occasionally have a course obligation that unavoidably conflicts with Jumuah prayer. Brown’s religious observance policy requires faculty, upon being notified by their students, to make reasonable accommodations for prayer and holiday observance. Most faculty will happily do their best to work it out. If this is your situation, please politely inform your instructor of your obligation as early as possible in the semester. A note to the faculty can easily be arranged if requested. If there’s a more complicated issue, or if you are facing a resistant or punitive faculty member, please email Imam Amir to discuss.

Call for volunteers. To set up up for prayer and clean up after lunch, we need volunteers! With regular help, this can easily be completed in ten minutes or less on each end. Please sign up here if you can give your time. These volunteers will work under the direction of the BMSC Coordinator (see next section) and Imam Amir.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/304783-jumuah-prayer-muslim-friday-service,41.8268,-71.4031,0,0,0.0

  Talk Title: Does AI need to be artificial? Does it need to be intelligent?
Abstract: In this talk we consider the fascinating possibility of organoid intelligence (OI). Organoid intelligence using human derived pluripotent stem cells to create neural clusters with measurable neuronal activity. We discuss a recent JHU effort in OI from a team of neuroscientists, engineers, signal processors and statisticians. The goal is to use organoids to perform complex computing tasks through stimulation and response. Measurement is obtained from an electrode shell custom designed for three dimensional measurements. Apart from OI, organoids electrophysiology experiments are useful for studying human genetic disorders and toxicity through another phenotype in vitro. Here, we will focus on the statistical challenges underlying this novel form of measurement. Time permitting, we will discuss other efforts in biocomputing.

While there have been significant advances in multimodal learning, little is known about how multimodal learning methods integrate signals from different modalities into a coherent representation of the task and environment. Such questions are relevant for work which, for example, seeks to integrate modalities into a coherent world model, for the sake of building multimodal AI agents. This thesis approaches this question in three parts, evaluating the models in different environments, from synthetic grid worlds to naturalistic concept learning. In the first part, we show that embodied sequence modeling leads to the emergence of internal representations of environmental state information in a synthetic multimodal grid world. In the second part, we explore models trained with realistic vision and language inputs and find that the models do learn composable visual concepts. Finally we investigate whether multimodal models are robust to the noise from other modalities. This thesis concludes by discussing the steps forward which outline the goal of multimodal models for embodied agents.

Description:
Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to circadian rhythm disturbances and sleep
problems due to delayed circadian phase, social pressures, and societal obligations.
Sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions have been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including mental health problems. These health risks are especially pronounced during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period for both physical and psychological development. However, there is a lack of prospective studies examining the relationship between sleep and circadian disruptions and mental health problems in young adults, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
In this presentation, Dr. Wu will share research findings from a cohort study that explores (1) the associations between sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances and mental health outcomes, particularly symptoms of depression and anxiety; (2) the potential role of clock gene methylation in mediating the relationship between sleep, circadian rhythm disruptions and depression.",Online only,https://events.brown.edu/event/310927-sleep-circadian-rhythm-disruption-and-mental,,,0,0,0.0

Labor and delivery markets remain understudied in hospital merger research. While mergers are known to raise prices and may reduce marginal costs, their effects on care quality and outcomes are less clear. Using National Vital Statistics System data on all births in the contiguous U.S. from 2016 to 2022, we examine how merger-driven increases in Herfindahl-Hirschman Indices (HHI) affect access to care, delivery practices, and birth outcomes. We find that higher merger-induced hospital market concentration is associated with fewer births attended by physicians and generally improved birth outcomes—particularly for mothers covered by Medicaid. Mergers also reduced the likelihood of mothers delivering in a county different from their residence. Mechanism tests using Medicaid claims data show that merged hospitals experienced decreased Medicaid labor and delivery volume.

In collaboration with guest musicians, this adaptation carries the novel’s resonant themes of Blackness across language and sound, bridging music, literature, and translation. Consistent with the themes of translation from Portuguese to English, Marcus Grant and Rubel collaborated to rearrange the song in the style of jazz (also known as Black American Music). Hosted as part of the Symbolic Reparations Project, it invites reflection on the power of art to reimagine diasporic histories.

Join us at 6PM every Thursday while we explore the life of Joseph as God prepared him for a bigger future than he could ever imagine.
Each week we will enter through Joseph’s lens on what God was doing in his life using the Bible as our guide to understand the time, context, and how we are to experience the same journey that Joseph did today.
We will participate in breakout groups and then we will come back together for a community discussion with opportunities for trivia and winning some cool encouraging swag.
Invite someone each week to experience how they could ignite their faith every day for the rest of their lives.

_____________________________
Jumuah prayer is held on the Brown campus while classes are in session. Only one service is held each week.
Conflicts and accommodation. You may occasionally have a course obligation that unavoidably conflicts with Jumuah prayer. Brown’s religious observance policy requires faculty, upon being notified by their students, to make reasonable accommodations for prayer and holiday observance. Most faculty will happily do their best to work it out. If this is your situation, please politely inform your instructor of your obligation as early as possible in the semester. A note to the faculty can easily be arranged if requested. If there’s a more complicated issue, or if you are facing a resistant or punitive faculty member, please email Imam Amir to discuss.

Call for volunteers. To set up up for prayer and clean up after lunch, we need volunteers! With regular help, this can easily be completed in ten minutes or less on each end. Please sign up here if you can give your time. These volunteers will work under the direction of the BMSC Coordinator (see next section) and Imam Amir.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/304784-jumuah-prayer-muslim-friday-service,41.8268,-71.4031,0,0,0.0

Simmons Center for the Study of Slavery & Justice, 94 Waterman St., Providence, RI 02906","Please join us for the opening reception and viewing of the gallery exhibition The Unfinished Conversations Series, a global oral history project in which individuals reflect on the question, “how did racial slavery and colonialism shape this place?”
The Unfinished Conversations Series was catalyzed by the Simmons Center with the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of African American History and Culture in partnership with museums and communities communities in Senegal; Liverpool, United Kingdom; Africatown, United States of America; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Capetown and the Groot Constantia Wine Estate of South Africa; neighborhoods surrounding Brussels, Belgium; with communities in Kinshasa and the Kimbanguist Church in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as communities in Jamaica and the Charles Town Maroons. The full global archive of over 150 interviews across four continents is housed at the John Hay Library at Brown University.
The project is made possible through generous funding from Abrams Foundation and the Wyncote Foundation.
About the Exhibition
Racial slavery and European colonialism were foundational planks of the making of the modern world. However, that historical story has yet to be fully told. Catalyzed by the Simmons Center in 2014, the Global Curatorial Project was formed to tell that story. Its mission was to develop an international exhibition showcasing how these global systems shaped the modern world. The project foregrounds the experiences, lives, ideas, and ways in which the enslaved and the colonized attempted to “make a way out of no way.” As it unfolded, new issues emerged – if the voices of the enslaved and the colonized were going to be foregrounded, then how do we create a curatorial practice to achieve this? Out of this unfolding, a new archive was born – The Unfinished Conversations Series.
Digitally archived at the John Hay Library, The Unfinished Conversation Series is a living repository composed of more than 150 interviews that have taken place in nine languages across four continents. Drawing inspiration from the idea of the Black cultural theorist Stuart Hall, that cultural identity and history are not fixed but an “ever-unfinished conversation,” this oral history project was an experiment in decolonial curatorial practice.

Tanenbaum’s book argues that young people today are taking a stand for themselves and against the nonconsensual sexualization that shapes their daily lives through gendered dress codes, nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, sexual harassment, and assault. She contends that criticisms of young people for sharing photos of themselves online in revealing clothing miss the point: young people are working towards bodily autonomy in the face of a toxic, sexist culture. Join us for a conversation that will explore the broader questions that “sexy selfies” on social media raise about issues including privacy and surveillance, disinformation, and the intersections of race, gender, class, and entrepreneurism in the digital age.

Wendy Allison Lee ’05 A.M., ’12 Ph.D., Associate Director, Pembroke Center

Can we realize this promise without new conceptual frameworks for research and drug development? Through advances in brain imaging, multi-omics and advanced data analytics, neuroscience is positioned to evolve its classification system from categorical CNS conditions to biologically informed diseases, with the potential to transform the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for the next century.

Department of Chemistry, Hanyang University, Seoul 04763, Korea
We have been exploring the utility of 3,5-dibromo-2-pyrone as a new diene synthon in Diels-Alder chemistry. Its synthetic versatility has been further exuberated by the discovery that either of the two C-Br groups can be selectively functionalized through transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions. The resultant 3- or 5-substituted 2-pyrones were found to be potent neutral dienes and may undergo cycloaddition to afford an array of densely functionalized cyclohexenes. Recently, 2-pyrones with an asymmetrically positioned hydroxyl group in the tether have been found to undergo intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions with remarkably high π-facial- and endo-selectivities. The resulting diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure cycloadducts were transformed into various natural products. Recent findings on our unique diastereoselective IMDA reactions of 2-pyrones and their synthetic applications to (+)-lycopladine A, (-)-lycoposerramine R, (-)-cyanthiwigin B and (+)-platensimycin will be presented.",,https://events.brown.edu/event/310785-organic-chemistry-seminar-cheon-gyu-cho-hanyang,41.8259,-71.3995,0,0,0.0

442,COMMIT!,"2025-06-12 19:00:00",,EDT,The Lindemann Performing Arts Center - Riley Hall,"COMMIT! by Kate Ladenheim

COMMIT! is an interactive performance in which a performer (Ladenheim) executes hundreds of dramatic falls in an hour, while the audience uses a web app to vote on whether they believe the performer has truly committed. After rounds of falling, an avatar replica of Ladenheim reads the audience’s feedback aloud, while the live performer adjusts their actions in response. Throughout, motion capture and custom sensors collect data on each fall in an attempt to discover (and justify) the most “committed” fall there is.

Using gamified interactions to control a durational performance, COMMIT! explores the shifting boundaries between technological control and societal expectations. Through the performer’s repeated attempts to “commit,” the piece highlights tensions between physical effort and digital representation, as well as the audience’s role in shaping and judging the performer’s actions. In this way, COMMIT! critiques societal pressures to demonstrate resilience, adaptability, and perfection. The work emphasizes the inexact and often reductive nature of data collection and digital mediation, inviting reflection on how technology distorts and constrains identity and agency.

The institute is designed for Brown graduate students in the humanities and social sciences, but we welcome researchers of all levels (undergraduate to faculty) and all disciplines to join us for two week-long digital humanities workshops every summer.
We will offer first week of the series in person from May 28–30 in the Patrick Ma Digital Scholarship Lab (room 137), Rockefeller Library, and the second week, June 9–13 virtually via Zoom.
The first week of the series will focus on topics of importance across all digital humanities projects including: project development; finding, creating and cleaning your data; applying critical digital humanities methods; and more.
The second week of the series will pair students in the course with staff at the CDS to develop their project. Each day will have milestones to achieve such as: having a clear plan for the project; developing a metadata schema; choosing a digital platform; creating wireframes and mood boards. Students will have the opportunity to learn from their assigned mentor but also share back and learn from their cohort.
We are eager to train the next generation of scholars in digital humanities. Please make sure you can commit to the series before submitting your application. We plan the series based on the registrations we receive, and in order to plan appropriately we need a strong commitment from our applicants. The institute counts towards the Digital Humanities Doctoral Certificate Program.
Applications are due by May 1, 2025. Register here.",Online only,https://events.brown.edu/event/308579-digital-humanities-summer-institute-week-2,,,0,0,0.0
